# YARRR - Yet Another Rust Raytracer Rewrite

Study project of rewriting the famous [Ray Tracing in One Weekend by Peter Shirley](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html#thevec3class/vec3utilityfunctions) from C++ to Rust to practice the language.

Goals:

- not looking for other implementations until im done with first complete implementaton
- not using 3rd party linear algebra libraries until im done with first complete implementaton
- practice writting organizing rust modules, writing tests and using CI like it was a production ready tool
- have fun and show it to my mum when im done

Progress:

- [x] Vector math in 3D
- [ ] Basic PPM image format writer
- [ ] Rays
- [ ] Camera & Scene
- [ ] Adding sphere objects
